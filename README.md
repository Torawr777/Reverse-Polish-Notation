This program parses Reverse-polish notation(aka postfix notation), which is a way of writing expressions that avoids the need for parenthesis. 
It is a Turing-complete parser of a simpler dialect of the language, Forth. 
It can call its own functions within the Forth program(input) and utilize comparison operators.
